                me to assist in completing my education for B.E. Computer Engineering. I can’t describe in words for the
                donors like you when I look at myself at present. My father was a laborer in a small town Jasdan,
                Dist-Rajkot of Gujarat State and our family income was around Rs.3000/- (Three thousands only) per month
                when I was pursuing my study. It was definitely impossible to accomplish my study without the support
                you
                provided to me. At present, I am working at senior position in one of the IT company of Ahmedabad and my
                salary is Rs.40, 000/- (fourty thousands only) per month which is more than ten percent of earlier
                income
                of my family. Now I am able to assist my brother in his study, who is pursuing M.Sc. Chemistry at
                Saurashtra University Rajkot.</p>
              <p class="text-dark">Sir, I assure that after the completion of my post graduation I will be a part and
                parcel of GMAA. I will work honorary between native Gujarati students and GMAA. Please pray for me.”</p>
